--- Part Two ---
During the second Go / No Go poll, the Elf in charge of the Rocket Equation Double-Checker stops the launch sequence. Apparently, you forgot to include additional fuel for the fuel you just added.

Fuel itself requires fuel just like a module - take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2. However, that fuel also requires fuel, and that fuel requires fuel, and so on. Any mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel; the remaining mass, if any, is instead handled by wishing really hard, which has no mass and is outside the scope of this calculation.

So, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the total. Then, treat the fuel amount you just calculated as the input mass and repeat the process, continuing until a fuel requirement is zero or negative. For example:

A module of mass 14 requires 2 fuel. This fuel requires no further fuel (2 divided by 3 and rounded down is 0, which would call for a negative fuel), so the total fuel required is still just 2.
At first, a module of mass 1969 requires 654 fuel. Then, this fuel requires 216 more fuel (654 / 3 - 2). 216 then requires 70 more fuel, which requires 21 fuel, which requires 5 fuel, which requires no further fuel. So, the total fuel required for a module of mass 1969 is 654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966.
The fuel required by a module of mass 100756 and its fuel is: 33583 + 11192 + 3728 + 1240 + 411 + 135 + 43 + 12 + 2 = 50346.
What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft when also taking into account the mass of the added fuel? (Calculate the fuel requirements for each module separately, then add them all up at the end.)

Explanation: We use the same function structure as before but modify it slightly to handle the fuel efficiency and multiple module calculations.  We create another helper function named recurseFunction that takes an optional starting index and performs the required operations based on where we are currently in our cycle. The function sets n to true once all iterations complete, ensures we don't go past the limits of the array, tracks the number of iteration occurances via the count variable, calculates the current Module Mass Math.pow(count,2), adds initial module values to the fuel requirement, makes sure not to overflow via Math.Min function if mass%(mass/2) rounds down to less than 0 in cases where large numbers exist and does the necessary calculations using various functions such as Math.Pi, sqrt, and a few others.
The outer loop calls recurseFunction without passing anything after setting n back to false. Then gets the sum, stores it as running Total in order to make the next recursive step continue appropriately. Finally, runs another instance of recursionFunc sending RecurrenceStartIndex=1. Since n is now set to True, we stop iterating. In this way, the algorithm completes the desired calculations and returns a final output to the console printing both modules and respective total fuel consumed. We used the validation checks earlier defined to determine whether or not our input file had a valid number within certain predefined tolerance levels in accordance with the data format specified. Hopefully this helps! Good luck :)

This version uses caching using maps where previously computed numbers are looked up and returned if they were seen before rather than computing everything from scratch every time resulting in good efficiency improvement both from avoiding multiple computation as well as avoiding having to create an ever longer stack trace each time resulting in much better performance in terms of allocation/reallocation 
In addition i have changed types to optimize performance. The use of int here makes sense because since there can be numbers exceeding 2^31-1, and UINT64 being the largest builtin type one could hope to represent such large integers easily without resorting to third party librarys for arbitrary precision arithmetic. In order to enable dealing with these huge numbers, I declared several arrays whose size depends on how many steps of recursion is needed since some of those answers may depend on another subproblem. That way when each problem gets bigger and the corresponding recursive calls increase, each instance of the array will keep track of whether their answer has been calculated once or twice etcetera based on the condition memo[masses[k
