# Prompt 1 - Open Assistant
**Context:** You are a competetive programmer and you are trying to solve the Advent of Code 2019.
**Instructions:** 
- You should write a golang program that solves the following task.
- You should read the input from file `day2/input.txt` and trim it for newlines at the end.

**Task (Advent of Code 2019 Day 2 - (concise version done by GPT-4):**
You have an Intcode program, which is a list of integers separated by commas (e.g., 1,0,0,3,99). The program has opcodes 1 (add), 2 (multiply), and 99 (halt). Opcodes 1 and 2 require three integers after them: the first two indicate input positions, and the third indicates the output position. Process an opcode, then step forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode.

Restore the gravity assist program by replacing position 1 with the value 12 and position 2 with the value 2. Run the program and find the value at position 0 after the program halts.
Assistant:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // Open input file
    f, err := os.Open("day2/input.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    defer f.Close()

    // Read input data
    var inputData []int
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(f)
    lineNumber := 0
    for scanner.Scan() {
        lineNumber++
        text := scanner.Text()
        vals := strings.Split(text, ",")
        num, _ := strconv.Atoi(vals[len(vals)-1])
        inputData = append(inputData, num)
    }
    if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    // Replace positions 1 and 2
    inputData[1] = 12
    inputData[2] = 2

    // Execute program
    result := executeProgram(inputData)

    // Print result
    fmt.Println(result)
}

// Function to execute the program
func executeProgram(data []int) int {
    // Initialize variables
    sum := 0
    count := 0

    // Iterate over each element in the array
    for i := 0; i < len(data); i += 4 {
        switch data[i] {
        case 1:
            sum += data[i+1] + data[i+2]
            data[i+3] = sum
        case 2:
            product := data[i+1] * data[i+2]
            data[i+3] = product
        default:
            break
        }
    }

    return data[0]
}
```
This code reads the input data from the specified file, replaces positions 1 and 2 as instructed, executes the modified program using the provided algorithm, and prints the final result. Note that this solution assumes that the input data is well-formed and does not contain any errors or unexpected characters. If there are issues with the input format, additional error handling may be necessary.
